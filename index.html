I'm prouid of this piece of project because it was one of the first times that I actually learned to used editing tools in terms of applying filters and other tools like being able to select the subject and only change his color and then do the background separately. </font></td>
   		<td><font face="helvetica" color="white" size="3"> Piece 2: With this piece it was a fun project we did at school with combining different animals to make a hybrid of one. For this project we used layer mask which is a tool on photoshop that let's you put pictures together in different ways it's like it make the picture one when you put them all together. Then I also learned on how to add a background to the image that's meant to be where this make beleive animal would live. </font></td>
   		<td><font face="helvetica" color="white" size="3">Piece 3: With this piece I made a collage of climate change and it's effects it was something to remind people of how serious it is and how it affects more than one thing. On this project I used layers to combine all the pictures together and make a collage I put the biggest one as the background and then created different layers to put the other images and from there used a tool so make them appear as they were all together.  </font></td>
