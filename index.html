I’m a student athlete that's going to graduate early by the end of January. Some personal goals that I have is being able to study in the field that I want and be able to enjoy doing my job while also being high paying. Another one of my goals is being the first from my dad's side of the family to go to college. Something that motivates me to succeed in being able to support my family. Another major motivation is being able to give back to my mom for everything she’s done for me and everything that she continues to do for me.
